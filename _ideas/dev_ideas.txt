- Model verbose names values
	It is recommended to always provide explicit verbose_name and verbose_name_plural options rather than
	relying on the fallback English-centric and somewhat naïve determination of verbose names Django performs by
	looking at the model’s class name:

	from django.db import models
	from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _


	class MyThing(models.Model):
	  name = models.CharField(_('name'), help_text=_('This is the help text'))
	  class Meta:
	    verbose_name = _('my thing')
	    verbose_name_plural = _('my things')
